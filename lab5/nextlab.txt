R1: array

        int val;
        vector<R2*> children;
    }
    
    R1-> R2
        link nodes as we iterate R1 array
        mark root when -1 and return it


R3:
    struct R3{
        int value;
        R3* left;
        R3* right;
    }    

    R2-> R3:

        breadth first generation strategy:
        recursively generate left first

Pretty pretty_print for each representation:
    + Doesn't have to be linear
